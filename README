imagefs allows you to create a file on your hard disk (or any other drive) and treat it as if
it were a floppy disk.  imagefs lets you copy files onto and delete file from this virtual
floppy disk, install boot sector code, and display a directory of files on the virtual disk.

imagefs is especially useful for testing bootable software with Bochs.  Instead of being
forced to copy your files to a diskette every time you want a test run, you can now have
bochs boot the image file instead.  This saves minutes every time you test.  Plus, you can
include calls to imagefs in your makefile, thus automating the process.

imagefs was developed for use in the development of the Slikware operating system
