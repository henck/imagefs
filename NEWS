Version 1.02
------------

Bugfix: when you run 'imagefs add myimage /src/boot/myfile', meaning that you wish to
add '/src/boot/myfile' to the 'myimage' disk image, imagefs would place the entire
string '/SRC/BOOT/MYFILE' in the image file's FAT table.  It should have written only
'MYFILE' there.  Fixed.


Version 1.01
------------

Bugfix: version 1.00 reported (erroneously) that files could not be found when adding them,
but added them anyway.  This flaw has been fixed.


Version 1.00
____________

Initial release.
